# Practising Strategy: A Book Review
 
Practising Strategy: A Southern African Context 2e is a book by Tersia Botha and Peet Venter, published by Juta Limited in 2019. The book aims to provide a different perspective on strategic management, focusing on strategy implementation rather than strategy formulation, and acknowledging the complexity, uncertainty and human aspects of strategy in organisations. The book also draws on primary research among southern African top and middle managers to enrich the material with firsthand accounts of the strategy experience.

The book consists of 12 chapters, organised into four parts. Part 1 introduces the concept of strategy and its evolution, as well as the challenges and opportunities of practising strategy in a southern African context. Part 2 explores the different actors and roles involved in strategy, such as top management, middle managers, consultants and stakeholders. Part 3 examines the process of strategy implementation, covering topics such as strategic alignment, change management, organisational culture and performance measurement. Part 4 discusses some contemporary issues and trends in strategy, such as sustainability, innovation, digitalisation and ethics.
 
The book is written in an accessible and engaging style, with numerous examples, case studies, diagrams and tables to illustrate the key concepts and theories. The book also includes learning outcomes, reflection questions, activities and references at the end of each chapter to facilitate learning and application. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of strategic management, as well as practitioners and researchers who are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of strategy in a southern African context.
  
Some of the main themes and insights that emerge from the book are:
 
- Strategy is not a static and linear process, but a dynamic and iterative one that requires constant adaptation and experimentation.
- Strategy is not only about rational analysis and decision making, but also about intuition, creativity and learning.
- Strategy is not only the domain of top management, but also involves middle managers, consultants and other stakeholders who have different roles and contributions to make.
- Strategy is not only a cognitive process, but also a political one that involves power, conflict and negotiation.
- Strategy is not only a technical issue, but also a cultural one that requires alignment of values, beliefs and behaviours.

The book offers a comprehensive and contemporary view of strategy that is relevant and applicable to the southern African context. It challenges the conventional wisdom and assumptions about strategy and provides a fresh and critical perspective that encourages readers to think differently and creatively about strategy. The book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about practising strategy in a complex and uncertain world.
