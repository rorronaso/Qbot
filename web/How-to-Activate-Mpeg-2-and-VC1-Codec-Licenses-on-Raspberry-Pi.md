# How to Activate Mpeg 2 and VC-1 Codec Licenses on Raspberry Pi
 
If you want to use your Raspberry Pi as a media center, you may encounter some video formats that require hardware decoding, such as Mpeg 2 and VC-1. These codecs are not enabled by default on the Raspberry Pi, and you need to purchase a license key from the official website to activate them. However, there is also a way to hack the firmware of the Raspberry Pi and patch the license check function, so that you can use these codecs without paying any fees. This article will show you how to do that, but please note that this is not an official or legal method, and you may risk damaging your device or violating the license agreement.

## What are Mpeg 2 and VC-1 Codecs?
 
Mpeg 2 and VC-1 are video compression standards that are widely used for DVD, Blu-ray, and streaming media. They offer high quality and efficiency, but they also require more processing power to decode. The Raspberry Pi has a dedicated hardware decoder for these codecs, but it is disabled by default because of licensing issues. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has to pay a fee to the patent holders for each device that uses these codecs, and they decided to make them optional for users who need them.
 
If you want to enable these codecs on your Raspberry Pi, you need to purchase a license key from the official website: [https://codecs.raspberrypi.org/](https://codecs.raspberrypi.org/). The license key costs Â£2.40 for Mpeg 2 and Â£1.20 for VC-1, and you need to provide your device's serial number to generate it. Once you have the license key, you need to add it to your config.txt file on your SD card and reboot your device.
 
## How to Hack the Firmware and Patch the License Check Function?
 
If you don't want to pay for the license key, or if you have lost it, there is another way to activate these codecs on your Raspberry Pi. This involves hacking the firmware of the device and patching the function that checks for the license key. This is a proof-of-concept script that was posted on Reddit by /u/fuck\_the\_mpeg\_la in 2017: [https://github.com/suuhm/raspi\_mpeg\_license\_patch.sh](https://github.com/suuhm/raspi_mpeg_license_patch.sh). This script is based on the reverse-engineering efforts of /u/nucular on GitHub: [https://github.com/nucular/raspi-keygen](https://github.com/nucular/raspi-keygen).
 
The script works by modifying the start.elf file, which is a firmware blob for the VideoCore IV processor used by all Raspberry Pi models. It changes one byte in the code that determines whether the codec is licensed or not, so that it always returns true. This effectively bypasses the license check and enables hardware decoding for Mpeg 2 and VC-1.
 
To run the script, you need to download it from GitHub and execute it on your Raspberry Pi with root privileges. You can also specify your operating system as a parameter, such as raspbian, libreelec, osmc, or xbian. For example, if you want to patch libreelec, you can run this command:
 `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suuhm/raspi_mpeg_license_patch.sh/main/raspi_mpeg_license_patch.sh -qO- | bash -s -- --patch-now --os=libreelec` 
After running the script, you need to reboot your device for the changes to take effect. You can also use the --check-only parameter to verify if your device is already patched or not.
 
## What are the Risks and Limitations of this Method?
 
While this method may seem tempting and easy, it also comes with some risks and limitations. First of all, this is not an official or legal way to use these codecs on your Raspberry Pi. You may be violating the license agreement of the patent holders and exposing yourself to legal consequences. You may
